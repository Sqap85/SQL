“Academia is another good example (of a zombie firm), where students pay ever-more-exorbitant fees to enter universities only to be taught by professors who spend very little time and effort on the teaching and mentoring of students, focusing most their time on publishing unreadable research to get get government grants and climb the corporate academic ladder.”
